#qb-file-bytes

**qb-file-bytes** is a dos app to read the bytes of a file one-by-one.
It is very similar to that of a hex editor, except that this is way
more user-unfriendly than a standard hex-editor. The bytes can be seen
in character, decimal, hex, and binary format.


##demo

<img src="/assets/img/0.png" width="70%"><br/>
Enter `Filename` whose bytes are to be seen / written down.
<br/><br/>


<img src="/assets/img/1.png" width="70%"><br/>
Press `Enter` to view next byte (repeat).
<br/><br/>


<img src="/assets/img/2.png" width="70%"><br/>
Un-displayable characters as shown as `...`.
